* ``--seq_type=type`` with ``type = {random,increasing,decreasing}`` specifies the input type (see paper)
* ``--delta=x`` specifies the delta of pseudo-increasing and -decreasing sequences (see paper) 

Results are located in folder results/ after experiment execution. 
Use R-Script ``script/rmq_stats.R`` to convert results into tikz-Figures.
